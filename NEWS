	  Version 0.04

Added ability to for `coxsimtvc` to calculate `'Relative Hazard', 'First Difference', and 'Hazard Ratios'. 

Corresponding graphing functions added to `ggtvc`.

Real time (time before transformation in TVC) used in the plots.

Set default ylab to the value of qi.

      Version 0.03.1

Examples and documentation improvements.

      Version 0.03

Added `ggfitStrata` for plotting stratified survival curves both in one plot and separated into individual plots arranged in a grid.

      Version 0.02
Added ability to simulate and graph conditional hazard rates from stratified Cox PH models.

      Version 0.01.1

Added the command tvc which creates creates a time interaction variable that can be used in a coxph model (or any other model with time interactions)

      Version 0.01

This is the first version of simtvc. It simulates time-varying hazard ratios for one
coefficient at a time estimated from a Cox Proportional Hazards model. It also provides
tools for graphing the simulations overtime.
