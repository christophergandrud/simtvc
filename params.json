It can also simulate and graph stratified non-proportional hazard rates from Cox models.\r\n\r\nThe package includes four functions:\r\n\r\n- `tvc`: a function for creating time interactions. Currently supports `'linear'`, natural `'log'`, and exponentiation (`'power'`).\r\n\r\n- `coxsimtvc`: a function for simulating time-varying hazard ratios from a Cox PH model estimated using `coxph` from the [survival](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) package. For more information see this [blog post](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/10/graphing-non-proportional-hazards-in-r.html). If `strata = FALSE` the function will also calculated time-varying hazard ratios for multiple strata estimated from a stratified Cox PH model.\r\n\r\n- `ggtvc`: uses [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) to graph the simulated hazard ratios or stratified hazard rates.\r\n\r\n- `ggfitStrata`: a function to plot fitted stratified survival curves estimated from `survfit` using **ggplot2**. This function builds on the **survival** package's `plot.survfit` command. One major advantage is the ability to split the survival curves into multiple plots and arrange them in a grid. This makes it easier to examine many strata at once. Otherwise they can be very bunched up.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) command `install_github` to install **simtvc** in R. Here is the exact code for installing version 0.02:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"simtvc\", \"christophergandrud\", ref = \"v0.03.1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n\r\nFor more information about simulating parameter estimates to make interpretation of results easier see:\r\n\r\nLicht, Amanda A. 2011.

I intend to expand the quantities of interest that can be simulated and graphed for Cox PH models. I am also currently working on functions that can simulate and graph hazard ratios estimated from [Fine and Gray competing risks models](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2670170). \r\n\r\nI am also working on a way to graph hazard ratios with frailties. \r\n","name":"simtvc","tagline":"Tools for simulating and graphing time-varying coefficients."}
