Package: simtvc
Title: Tools for simulating and graphing time-varying hazards.
Description: The package simulates and plots non-proportional hazards (relative hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) from Cox Proportional Hazard models and plots the results as hazard ratios. It can also simulate and graph stratified non-proportional hazard rates from Cox models.
